THOUGHTS:
Okay after using this library for this project, I've come to realize opinionated libraries
  can be difficult to work with if you have something specific in mind
Going to finish this with the functionality I wanted to begin with, and for my next project,
  will only use UI libraries when they do what I want / are explictly meant for customizing it the way I intend


HEADER
-Sticky Header
-Replace Header file with one that repeats nicely
-Add PokeBerry text to Header img

GRID
-Look into solution for drag / drop cards?
-One day, make the grid actually stay square even when window resizes
  (Currently, grid gaps are the same but width / height will change on resize)

ITEM INFO
-Lots to do (like everything)

ITEM MODAL
-Should this just go away? Still have to figure out class separation

FOOTER
-Where the frick is that extra space between the expand button and the actual content coming from?
-Do I need the expansion to be controlled?
-Text isn't centered
-Shadow to distinguish footer from cards -> Overwriting MUI's classes seems difficult, might be better to write own

SITE
For a lot of these, probably better not to use an opinionated UI library, 
  practice implementing on own first at least

FUNCTION
Turns out poffin making is not what I remembered and it's mostly based on how you stir and that's it,
Not really about the combo of berries
